Unison -- contract review, judged by the network itself.

A source url goes in. Out comes a mark out of ten against the rubric published
below, by validators who each read the source and mark it themselves. Nothing
here marks anything on behalf of a server.

Three consensus rounds: `strict_eq` over the fetched source, so every validator
marks a character-identical prompt; then the contract's marks; then the site's,
when a site is given. Four contract criteria are counted in deterministic code
and identical on every node; the jury decides `necessity` and all five site
criteria. Totals are summed here from those integers and the band is a pure
function of the total -- no model is ever asked for a total.

Agreement is the published tolerance in `agreement_holds`. Reasons are checked
for shape, never compared: comparing prose under equality is the reliable way to
make honest validators disagree.

Untrusted text is fenced at the prompt boundary -- `<` and `>` become `(` and
`)` -- so no payload can close `</source>` or forge a `<rubric>` block. Storage
keeps the text verbatim.

The reasoning, and the measurements behind it, are in docs/judgment-layer.md:
on-chain bytes cost, and a build diary is not part of a published standard.

# Which criteria a count can settle, and which need the jury.
#
# Measured: three markings of one source from ONE node came back [0,2,0,1,0],
# [0,2,0,2,0] and [0,2,0,0,1] -- so even the BAND flipped. An anchor a count can
# settle should be settled by the count; asking a model to re-derive "are the
# calls grouped" from source it was handed samples the model, not the contract.
#
# So four contract criteria are counted in deterministic code from the agreed
# bytes and are identical on every validator by construction. The jury keeps
# what a count cannot reach: `necessity`, a question about intent rather than
# text, and all five site criteria, because reading a live page and deciding
# whether a claim outruns the contract is irreducibly semantic -- and is the
# part of this product GenLayer is required for.

# Evidence. The discriminating facts the anchors turn on, computed in

# Reading the source as code rather than as text.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Every counted criterion used to be decided by

# call: a line in a comment, a name inside a docstring and a url in a string
# literal all scored exactly like working code, so a file could be written to
# pass without doing any of the things the rubric asks about. A mark has to
# come from what the file would EXECUTE.
#
# `ast` is available on a node -- probed on Studio before this was written, and
# it correctly found two real calls in a sample carrying four textual mentions
# of one. Parsing is deterministic, so every validator building this table from
# the agreed bytes builds the identical table without spending an inference.
#
# A file that does not parse is not scored as though it were code. `analyse`
# reports `parsed = False` and every counted criterion answers 0 with that as

    the marks.

    AND ONLY ON THE JUDGED ONE, which took three rounds of the wrong fix to see.

    A site's counted marks are read off each node's own render, so they are
    deterministic in the sense that the same page always gives the same answer,
    and not deterministic at all in the sense that matters here: two honest
    nodes do not hold the same page. A slower rpc, a slower font, anything that
    leaves one render a second behind at the 1200ms mark, and `finality` is 2 on
    one node and 0 on the other, from a difference neither of them judged.

    Comparing the whole vector then spent the published tolerance -- one point,
    one criterion -- on that noise, and there was nothing left for the criterion
    the tolerance exists for. Three live assays came back 3 agree to 2 disagree
    while `overreach` moved 1, 0, 0 on one unchanged page, and moving criteria
    from the jury into the count made it worse each time rather than better,
    because every criterion moved was another render-dependent number entering
    the comparison.

    So the vote is on the judged mark alone. The counted marks still go on the
    report, still come from the anchors, and are no longer a way for two honest
    nodes to disagree about a page neither of them was asked to agree on.

    `mark_contract` deliberately keeps comparing everything. Its counted half is
    read from bytes the network agreed on under `strict_eq`, so two nodes there
    really do hold the same input, and a difference really is a disagreement.

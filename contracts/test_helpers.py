"""
Run the pure half of contracts/unison.py on plain CPython.

    python contracts/test_helpers.py            # human output
    python contracts/test_helpers.py --json     # parity report for node

Everything above the "The non-deterministic rounds" banner in unison.py is a
pure function of its arguments: the normalisation, the digest, the gate, the
bands, the fence, the prompt builder and the whole ballot parser. None of it
needs a GenVM, a network or a deployment, which matters because genlayer-test
downloads a GenVM binary and there is no Windows build of it.

The import works by exec'ing the source with the `genlayer` line removed and a
two-field stand-in for `gl.vm.UserError` supplied, because importing the module
for real would need the SDK on the host.

--json prints the same answers as a machine-readable report. tests/parity reads
it and re-derives every one of them in TypeScript, which is the only thing that
keeps lib/gate.ts honest: the browser refuses submissions on the strength of
this gate, and a browser gate that disagrees with the chain's either refuses
work the chain would mark, or waves through work the chain will refuse after
somebody has paid for a signature.

/**
 * The workspace's Home pane: source in, and everything a submission turns into.
 *
 * The design's compose screen, wired to the real thing.
 *
 * ONE PATH, AND IT ALWAYS ENDS IN A SIGNATURE. The design offers a paste box
 * beside the url, and this carried it for a while as a free local check. It
 * had to go: it looked like the other half of the same feature and was not,
 * so people pasted a contract, watched the gate tick six boxes, and concluded
 * they had been reviewed when no transaction had been sent and no validator
 * had seen anything.
 *
 * Pasting cannot be reviewed, for reasons that are not ours to route around.
 * Validators fetch the file themselves -- that is the whole claim -- so text
 * in one browser is reachable by none of them. Putting the source in the
 * calldata instead would mean the jury taking the submitter's word for what it
 * is, and Studio rejects a write argument somewhere between 5,000 and 20,000
 * characters anyway, which most real contracts exceed.
 *
 * WHAT RUNS WHERE: this browser fetches the source, runs the published gate,
 * hashes it and asks the chain whether those exact bytes already hold a
 * report. A refusal stops there and costs nothing. Everything past that point
 * is one transaction, signed in the visitor's own wallet.
 *
 * The rail, the header chips and the theme switch belong to `WorkspaceShell`;
 * this renders the pane and its own title, which follows the phase the way the
 * design's `appTitle` does.

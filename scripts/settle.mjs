 * The one question a rubric judged by a jury has to answer about itself. Five
 * independent 0/1/2 judgments matching EXACTLY is five coin flips, and the
 * spec's consensus line ("5 of 5 agreed, exactly, on every criterion") only
 * means anything if that happens most of the time rather than occasionally.
 *
 * Prints the three receipt fields that get confused for each other on every
 * attempt, because a disagreement and a broken contract look identical in two

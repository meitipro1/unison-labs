/**
 * Deploy one Unison contract.
 *
 *   $env:UNISONLABS_DEPLOYER_KEY = "0x..."     # PowerShell
 *   npm run deploy -- --yes
 *
 * The rubric and the gate are compiled into contracts/unison.py and no
 * method anywhere in it can edit a criterion, an anchor, a probe or a band.
 * "Published before anyone was scored" has to mean something, and what it means
 * is that this transaction is the last moment any of it can change.
 *
 * So everything checkable is checked before the send: the runner header is
 * pinned, the pure half's own suite passes, and the gate the browser will run
 * matches the gate the chain will run.

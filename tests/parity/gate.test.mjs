/**
 * The browser gate and the contract gate must be the same gate.
 *
 *   npm test
 *
 * lib/gate.ts refuses submissions on its own authority, before any transaction
 * exists. If it disagrees with contracts/unison.py by one character, one of
 * two things happens and both are bad: it refuses work the chain would have
 * marked, or it waves through work the chain refuses after somebody has already
 * signed for it.
 *
 * So nothing here is written by hand. contracts/test_helpers.py --json prints
 * every answer the Python half gives -- the spec, the digests, the gate rows,
 * the band table, the normalisation edge cases -- and this file re-derives all
 * of them in TypeScript and compares.
 *
 * Node 24 strips types from .ts on import, so the real module is under test
 * rather than a copy of it.

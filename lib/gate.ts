/**
 * The gate, in the browser. Step one, and it costs nothing.
 *
 * This is a deliberate twin of `normalise`, `digest_of` and `gate_of` in
 * contracts/unison.py. It exists so a refusal never becomes a transaction:
 * a file with no runner header and no non-deterministic call is not an
 * Intelligent Contract, and finding that out should not cost a validator an
 * inference.
 *
 * THE TWIN IS THE RISK, so three things hold it in place.
 *
 *  1. Substrings only. Every probe is plain containment, case sensitive, with
 *     no regular expressions on either side -- the one text operation that
 *     cannot drift between Python and JavaScript.
 *  2. The spec is published. `gate_spec()` on the contract returns the probes
 *     themselves, so `runGate` takes a spec argument and the app passes the
 *     chain's. SPEC below is the compiled-in copy for a cold start, and
 *     tests/parity pins it against the Python one character for character.
 *  3. The contract runs the gate again, on the bytes the validators agreed on.
 *     A browser running a softer gate gets a refusal from the chain instead of
 *     a mark.

/**
 * The wallet, in one place.
 *
 * The dApp needs the connected account in four places at once -- the connect
 * screen, the rail's card, the settings sheet and the assay button -- so it
 * lives in a context rather than being re-derived. Everything here is EIP-1193
 * and EIP-6963 against the browser's own extensions; no connector library, no
 * third party, and no key ever reaches this app.
 *
 * Six things this handles that a naive connect button does not:
 *
 *  1. It restores silently on load with `eth_accounts`, which returns the
 *     already-authorised account WITHOUT prompting. `eth_requestAccounts` on
 *     mount would throw a wallet popup at every visitor who ever connected.
 *  2. It follows `accountsChanged` and `chainChanged`. A wallet switched in
 *     another tab otherwise leaves the page showing an address that is no
 *     longer signing.
 *  3. It knows when the wallet is on the wrong chain and offers to switch,
 *     falling back to `wallet_addEthereumChain` on 4902 (chain unknown). A
 *     write sent to the wrong network fails in a way nobody can act on.
 *  4. Disconnect is local, and says so. EIP-1193 has no "revoke" -- the site
 *     forgets the account, the wallet does not -- and a button that implies
 *     otherwise is a lie about who holds the permission.
 *  5. It DISCOVERS wallets rather than assuming one. The design's connect
 *     screen offers three named wallets; EIP-6963 says which are really
 *     installed, so each button is that wallet and opens that wallet. See
 *     `lib/eip6963.ts`.
 *  6. It carries the balance, refreshed on demand, because the rail shows one
 *     and the faucet changes it.

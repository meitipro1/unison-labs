/**
 * The single place that decides which GenLayer network the whole app talks to.
 *
 * Unison runs on the Studio network. Flip it with one env var:
 *
 *   NEXT_PUBLIC_GENLAYER_NETWORK=bradbury
 *
 * Everything below derives from genlayer-js's own chain objects rather than
 * being retyped, so chain id, RPC url and native currency cannot drift out of
 * sync with the SDK.
 *
 * Three Studio facts change behaviour here rather than being trivia:
 *
 *  1. Studio is gasless. `eth_gasPrice` answers 0 and `eth_getBalance` answers
 *     0 for an account whose writes then succeed, so a pre-flight "you have no
 *     GEN" guard is correct on Bradbury and refuses every assay on Studio.
 *  2. Studio's explorer is explorer-studio.genlayer.com. genlayer-js carries
 *     genlayer-explorer.vercel.app for studionet, which answers 503 on every
 *     request, so that one url is hardcoded and everything else still derives.
 *  3. `gen_call` mis-encodes a view whose calldata runs past roughly 200 bytes,
 *     answering "RLP string ends with N superfluous bytes". Nothing here passes
 *     a long argument to a view: the gate runs in this browser, and the only
 *     long text the chain ever sees is fetched by the validators themselves.

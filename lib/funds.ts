/**
 * The balance in the rail, and the faucet beside it.
 *
 * The design draws a static `250 GEN` and a Faucet button that adds 100 to it.
 * Both are real here, because on Studio both can be:
 *
 *   balance   `eth_getBalance`, which reports correctly for a key-derived
 *             account. It answers `0x0` for an address the ledger has never
 *             seen, which is a true zero rather than a failure.
 *   faucet    `sim_fundAccount`, Studio's programmatic faucet. Bradbury has no
 *             such method; there the button becomes a link to the real faucet
 *             page, which is the honest equivalent.
 *
 * TWO MEASURED FACTS, both of which would otherwise become bugs:
 *
 *  1. `sim_fundAccount` CREDITS THE ACCOUNT AND THEN ERRORS if the amount is
 *     passed as a hex string -- it answers
 *     `-32603  '<=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'`
 *     while the balance goes up by the full amount. So the amount is a JSON
 *     number, and an error from this method is never reported as "nothing
 *     happened": a retry loop on that error funds the account again each time.
 *     Verified against studio.genlayer.com on 2026-08-21.
 *  2. 100 GEN is 1e20 wei, which is past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` but is
 *     still exact in a float64 (it is 2^20 x 5^20). Any amount is checked for
 *     that before it is sent rather than assumed.
 *  3. IT ANSWERS WITH A TRANSACTION HASH FOR AN ADDRESS STUDIO DOES NOT HOLD,
 *     and credits nothing. Studio's ledger only knows accounts it has seen, so
 *     an address it has never met stays at zero across a call that looks like
 *     it worked. A hash from this method is therefore NOT evidence of a
 *     credit, and no caller may report one from it. `components/WalletCard.tsx`
 *     reads the balance before and after and says whichever is true.
 *
 * Studio charges no gas, so a balance there is worth showing and is not worth
 * gating anything on. `REQUIRES_GAS` in `lib/chain.ts` is the flag that says
 * which of those two worlds we are in.

/**
 * The pool, as the network actually reports it.
 *
 * The design's Validators screen shows five nodes, each with its own mark out
 * of ten and the word "undisclosed" where its model would be. The marks cannot
 * be real and the models need not be:
 *
 *   PER-VALIDATOR MARKS DO NOT EXIST, anywhere, at any layer. A validator's
 *   vote under Optimistic Democracy is one bit -- it agrees with the leader's
 *   result or it does not -- and that aggregate is all the contract or the
 *   receipt ever carries. There is no number to show per node, and drawing five
 *   nines would be inventing the one thing this whole product is about.
 *
 *   THE MODELS ARE PUBLISHED. `sim_getAllValidators` returns every validator's
 *   address, stake, provider and model. So the screen shows what the network
 *   says about itself, and the honest note is that the assignment of nodes to a
 *   given review is not something a contract can see.
 *
 * Studio only. Bradbury has no `sim_` namespace, and the screen says so rather
 * than showing an empty pool as though the pool were empty.

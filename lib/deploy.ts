/**
 * Deploy the reviewed bytes, from the author's own wallet.
 *
 * The whole guarantee is one comparison, made twice. Before anything is
 * signed, the file is fetched again and has to hash to the report's digest, so
 * a branch that moved since the review, or a url that now serves something
 * else, is refused rather than deployed under a report that was never about it.
 * After the deploy finalizes, the new contract's code is read back off the chain
 * and hashed again, so the page says whether what is running is what was
 * reviewed instead of assuming it.
 *
 * What goes on chain is the normalised source, the exact string the digest was
 * taken over, so the second comparison can never be a near miss explained away
 * by a trailing newline.

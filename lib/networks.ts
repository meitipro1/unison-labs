/**
 * Where a reviewed contract may be deployed.
 *
 * A review says nothing about which network the author wants to run on, so the
 * deploy asks. Every id below was read from the network itself with
 * `eth_chainId` rather than copied from a table: studionet answered 0xf22f,
 * Studio Next 0xf22d, and Asimov and Bradbury both answered 0x107d.
 *
 * That last one is the fact worth carrying. Asimov and Bradbury share chain id
 * 4221, so a wallet cannot tell them apart and the switch prompt is identical
 * for both. What separates them is the node the transaction is submitted to,
 * which is why a target carries its own rpc and every call takes it from here
 * rather than from the network the site itself runs on.
 *
 * Studio Next runs the newer consensus, and the sdk that can talk to it cannot
 * read the older networks. Both are installed, and `runtime` is what picks
 * between them.
 *
 * A leaf module with no relative imports, so tests/parity runs it directly.

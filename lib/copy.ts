 * The copy deck, chapter twelve, set exactly.

 * support.
 *
 * Rules that apply to every string here:
 *   sentence case, active voice, no exclamation marks anywhere in the product
 *   no sentence addresses the reader as `you` except the two card headings
 *   numbers are numerals: nine is written 9
 *   the middle dot is the only separator, with a space either side
 *   the ellipsis is one character and only ever inside a hash or a url
 *
 * ONE DEVIATION, and it is deliberate. The deck's consensus line reads
 * "5 of 5 agreed, exactly, on every criterion". Bare equality on five
 * three-way judgments settled 0 of 3 assays on Studio, so the contract now
 * applies a published tolerance instead, and CONSENSUS below says what the rule
 * actually is. A string that describes a rule the contract does not apply is
 * the one kind of copy this product cannot carry.
